	<h1>commission work</h1>
	<p>If you're interested in commissioning a piece from me, send an email to annawflowers@gmail.com. Please include as much detail as you can about what you are looking for. If you've been dreaming about something forever and have an inspiration board on Pinterest, include a link! If all you know is that you want a new dress for wedding season, that's fine too. Please also include the date when you would like to wear the piece.</p>
	<p>To make a custom piece, I'll start by taking your measurements and creating a basic pattern called a sloper, to fit your body. We'll check the fit of the sloper and make any adjustments necessary before I start on the garment itself. When the garment is finished, we'll do another fitting to make sure everything is exactly how you want it. If not, I'll make adjustmets until you're happy.</p>
	<p>Pricing will depend on the complexity of the piece and the materials required.</p>
