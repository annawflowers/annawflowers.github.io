	<div id="about">
		<p>I am a Brooklyn based designer and seamstress. My work is designed, pattered, cut, and sewn in the comforts of my studio (sometimes I brainstorm on the 4 train).</p>
		<p>I've always loved to sew, because of the unique combination of art and math that's involved in the craft. As a child of engineers, I was raised on math. It's not so clear where the art came from. Designing is creative and imaginitive. Pattern-making is a geometry puzzle. Stitching is a technically demanding craft.</p>
		<p>Before I pick up a needle and thread, I start with a 2-D model of my subject. I take dozens of measurements and combine them to create a baseline pattern for the subject's body. This pattern is called a sloper, and it becomes the basis for a well fitted design. Slopers also make great wall art if you're in the market for a non-traditional self-portrait.</p>
		<p>The most important elements that come into my designs are structure, silhouette, and function. I favor classically feminine silhouettes - accentuated waistlines, fitted tops, full skirts. After that the fun is in the details. I believe strongly that if it can have pockets, it should have pockets.</p>
